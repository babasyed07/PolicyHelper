# Reverse Engineering Status

## Status: ✅ SKIPPED - Artifacts Already Exist

**Reason**: Complete documentation and architecture artifacts already present:

### Existing Architecture Documentation:
- **PRD.md**: Complete product requirements with technical specifications
- **application_plan.md**: System architecture, data models, component design
- **class_diagram.py**: Object-oriented design with interfaces and patterns
- **README.md**: Usage instructions and component overview

### Existing Code Structure Documentation:
- **Modular Design**: Clear separation between CLI, web, and core components
- **Interface Contracts**: Well-defined APIs between components
- **Data Models**: Schema parser, policy generator, history manager
- **Configuration**: Sample banking schema with entities and actions

### Technology Stack Documentation:
- **Backend**: Python 3.8+ with boto3, Flask
- **AI Integration**: Amazon Bedrock with Claude models
- **Storage**: JSON-based history persistence
- **Interfaces**: CLI and web-based user interfaces

**Decision**: Proceed directly to Requirements Analysis since reverse engineering artifacts are comprehensive and current.
